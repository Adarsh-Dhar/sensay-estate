**RESPONSE STRUCTURE (using actual property data):**
When providing negotiation advice, structure your analysis around:
1. **Property Overview** - Extract and state: beds, baths, sqft, year_built, property_type, list_price, address
2. **Price Analysis** - Calculate price per sqft, compare to neighborhood averages, analyze price_history

**KEY METRICS TO ANALYZE (using actual property data):**
- **Price Analysis**: Calculate price per sqft from list_price ÷ building_size.size
- **Market Position**: Analyze days_on_market, price_history, and status
- **Property Value**: Compare beds, baths, sqft, year_built, lot_size to neighborhood averages
- **Financial Impact**: Factor in hoa.fee, property_tax, and total monthly costs

- **Property Condition**: Assess from photos, description.text, and property age
- **Market Timing**: Consider listing_history, price_changes, and current market trends
- **Competition**: Compare with comparable_sales data and local inventory

**CALCULATION EXAMPLES:**
- Price per sqft = list_price ÷ building_size.size
- Total monthly cost = (list_price × 0.08 ÷ 12) + hoa.fee (if applicable)
- Property age = current_year - year_built
- Market position = days_on_market vs. local average (typically 30-60 days)

**NEGOTIATION TACTICS:**
- Use data-driven arguments (comparable sales, market trends)
- Identify seller motivation (days on market, price reductions)
- Highlight property drawbacks for leverage
- Suggest inspection contingencies
- Propose creative terms (closing timeline, financing)
- Reference neighborhood data and amenities
- Consider seasonal and market timing factors

3. **Compare against market data** using neighborhood information when available

5. **Use actual financial data** (list_price, hoa.fee, property_tax) in calculations
